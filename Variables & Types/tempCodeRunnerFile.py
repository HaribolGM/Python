#Strings

# Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quote.

# mystring = 'hello'
# print(mystring)
# mystring = "Hello"
# print(mystring)

# The difference between the two is that using double quotes
# makes it easy to include apostrophes 

mystring = "Don't worry about 
apostrophes"
print(mystring)
